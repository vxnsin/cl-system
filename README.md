# CL - System

**CL - System** is an older Discord bot originally developed for the "Community Lounge" server, which has been deleted. I’ve invested a lot of time and effort into creating this bot, but since I no longer have a use for it, I’ve decided to release it publicly.
> Please note that some systems might not work as expected, and you will need to update the Channel, Role, and Guild IDs in the configuration and code.

**Important Note**: I do **not provide support** for this bot. If you encounter issues or want to make customizations, you are responsible for handling them yourself.


## Requirements

- Node.js
- MongoDB

## License

You are free to use the bot, but no support or warranty is provided.
